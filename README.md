# Chaton Messenger for Android

Chat and video with your friends, family and colleagues.

Nice interface similar to Whatsapp Messenger, Facebook Messenger, or Signal.
Secure: E2EE encrypted private communications only. Completely FOSS. Will only be in F-Droid.
Privacy: the app does not need your phone number, and does not require access to your phone contacts.

Chaton is a Matrix Client based on [SchildiChat](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/SchildiChat-android).
Compared to the Element app, Chaton features following changes:
- Message bubbles enabled by default
- Follows the system setting for dark/light mode (enabled by default)
- Unified chat list for both direct and group chats  (enabled by default)
- Further small usability improvements

Additional features in development:
- Kids mode (to let your child communicate safely with trusted contacts only)
- Optional removal of public rooms, enabled by default
- No access to Rooms without encryption (please use another Matrix client if you need them)
- public rooms disabled (please use another Matrix client if you need them)

It is completely free (FOSS) and comes without the proprietary libraries for push notifications.
This might lead to higher delay for delivering messages.

This project is brand new, so consider it as alpha.
