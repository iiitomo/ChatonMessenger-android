# Chaton Messenger for Android

Chaton is an Android Matrix Client based on [SchildiChat](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/SchildiChat-android).
It provides by default a simple interface similar to Whatsapp Messenger, Facebook Messenger, or Signal.

Compared to the Element app, Chaton features following changes:
- Message bubbles enabled by default
- Follows the system setting for dark/light mode (enabled by default)
- Unified chat list for both direct and group chats  (enabled by default)
- Further small usability improvements

Additional features in development:
- Kids mode (to let your child communicate safely with trusted contacts only)
- Optional removal of public rooms, enabled by default

It is completely free (FOSS) and comes without the proprietary libraries for push notifications.
This might lead to increased battery drain and a higher delay for delivering messages.

This project is brand new, so consider it as alpha.
